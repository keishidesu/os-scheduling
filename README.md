# Operating System Scheduling Algorithm

[Screenshot of Program](./screenshot.png)

This project's purpose is to show the visualization of Operating System's scheduling algorithms specifically __Non-Preemptive SJF__, __Preemptive SJF__ and __Round Robin (Time Quantum 3)__. Moreover, a summary of the algorithms are visualized as a table where the turnaround and waiting time for each process are listed down. This project is developed using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), a framework that is built on top of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). This project is an assignment for Multimedia University's TSN2101 Operating System subject of the Computer Science course.     

This project was deployed using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and can be viewed using this link: [https://keishidesu.github.io/os-scheduling/](https://keishidesu.github.io/os-scheduling/)
